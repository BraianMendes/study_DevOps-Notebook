# Load Balancer
Load Balancer acts as the traffic cop sitting in front of your servers and routing client requests across all servers capable of fulfilling those requests in a manner that maximizes speed and capacity utilization and ensures that no one server is overworked. If a one of the servers goes down, the load balancer redirects traffic to the remaining online servers.
